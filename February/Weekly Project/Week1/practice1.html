		<h1>Reading</h1>
		<p>Reading is something I enjoyed as a kid, and at the time I enjoyed it simply because I loved storytelling.</p>
		<p>As I got older, I realised I liked the fact that I get to experience life through the lens of another. It made me aware of realities outside of mine.</p>
		<p>In recent times, it has become harder to read due to a lot of distractions and attention span. However, I have grown to like audio books and I love that I can listen to a book while performing a chore.

		<h3>Benefits of reading</h3>
		<p>To expand your knowledge.</p>
		<p>To expand your vocabulary.</p>
		<p>I believe reading certain books, especially fiction, increases ones ability to empathize. I believe reading amongst others, has helped understand there are realities and beliefs outside of mine, and I've learnt to respect and empathise where needed.</p>
