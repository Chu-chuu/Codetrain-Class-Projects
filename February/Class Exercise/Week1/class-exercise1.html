	<h1>The Queens Gambit</h1>
	<p>Approaching chess openings can be an intimidating part of learning the game. There are hundreds of possible openings and hundreds of well-studied variations based on those openings. Among these thousands of possibilities, the Queen’s Gambit is one of the oldest and best-known openings, one used to great effect by many grandmasters from the nineteenth century until today. It’s also a great opening for beginners.</p>

	<h3>What Is the Queen’s Gambit</h3>
	<p>The Queen's Gambit is one of the oldest and most reputable 1.d4 openings for White. Unlike 1.e4 openings, the Queen's Gambit usually evolves into a strategic game rather than an all-out tactical battle. Despite being around for centuries, this opening is still one of the cornerstones of every elite players' repertoire. It's also an excellent choice for beginners and intermediate players.</p>
	<p>The Queen’s Gambit consists of three moves:</p>
	<ol style="display:inline-block;" >
		<li>White moves the queen’s pawn two spaces forward.</li>
		<li>Black responds by moving her own queen pawn two spaces forward.</li>
		<li>Finally, white replies by bringing her queenside bishop’s pawn forward two spaces.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Using standard chess notation, this is written as:</p>
	<ul style="display:inline-block;">
		<li>d4 d5</li>
		<li>c4</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Why Is it Called the Queen’s Gambit?</h3>
	<p>Like all gambits, it begins with an offer to sacrifice material. In this case, white offers a wing pawn in exchange for better control of the center. It’s called the Queen’s Gambit because it begins with the queen’s pawn (as opposed to the King’s Gambit, which starts with 1.e4).</p>

	<h4>Black’s Responses to the Queen’s Gambit (Step-by-Step Guide)</h4>
	<ol style="display:inline-block;" >
		<li>Queen’s Gambit Accepted. Until the late nineteenth century, black’s response to the Queen’s Gambit was usually to protect the c-pawn.</li>
		<p>Following standard notation, the QGA can be written as:</p>
			<ul style="display:inline-block;" >
				<li>d4 d5</li>
				<li>c4 dxc4</li>
			</ul>
		<p>From there, most mainline (or orthodox) versions of the QGA go something like this:</p>
			<ul style="display:inline-block" >
			<li>Nf3 Nf6</li>
			<li>e3 e6</li>
			<li>Bxc4 c5</li>
			<li>0-0 a6</li>
		</ul>

		<li>Queen’s Gambit Declined. While there are some good reasons for black to accept the Queen’s Gambit, it’s more common to decline.</li>
		<p>Following standard notation, the QGA can be written as:</p>
			<ul style="display:inline-block" >
				<li>d4 d5</li>
				<li>c4 e6</li>
			</ul>
		<p>From there, white typically responds with 3. Nc3, which black can respond to a number of different ways, though the most common variation will involve responding with her own knight, thus:</p>
			<ul style="display:inline-block" >
				<li>Nc3 Nf6</li>
				<li>Bg5 Be7</li>
				<li>Nf3</li>
			</ul>
		<li>Slav Defense. The Slav Defense, so called because it’s been used with great success by a number of Russian masters in the first half of the 20th century, is technically a variation of the QGD.</li>
		<p>The main line of the Slav Defense goes like this:</p>
			<ul style="display:inline-block" >
				<li>d4 d5</li>
				<li>c4 c6</li>
			</ul>
		<p>Because black kept her pawn on e7, her light-squared bishop now has a free lane for development. The typical progression goes:</p>
			<ul style="display:inline-block" >
				<li>Nf3 Nf6</li>
				<li>Nc6 dxc4</li>
			</ul>
	</ol>
